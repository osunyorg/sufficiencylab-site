    Workshop to identify the ingredients and methodology for modelling sufficiency

    <p>Background  <br>   <br>The use of models and emission scenarios are pillars of the reports on climate change mitigation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), while  elements of earth system tipping points are reflected in WG1 reports and impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation fall under WG2 methodology (e.g., ISIMIP).Unfortunately, IPCC mitigation reports rely almost exclusively on global scenarios built in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) with the arguments that these scenarios are the only ones to integrate the interrelationship between the economy and the environment in the long-term. Several scholars pointed to flawed foundations of IAMs methodology, especially regarding risks, equity and justice challenges raised by climate change. Scenarios developed using IAMs also fail in answering the question of the speed and the nature of the climate action needed to avoid the announced climate breakdown in IAMs scenarios.Criticism of IAMs is growing. However, they do not question the underlying normative IAM framework, which is driven by largely exogenous socio-economic growth trajectories and utility maximization, nor do they question IAMs description of structural change, markets, technologies, North/South equity, and distributional issues. Instead, the most progressive critics of IAMs propose considering damage functions and altering the current underlying IAM framework to include a better description of structural and systemic changes needed to avoid the climate breakdown.The latest IPCC workshop on scenarios suggests a continuation of the use of IAMs for the next assessment report by considering few improvements such as equity and distribution. The proposed changes are unlikely to make IAMs valuable tools to provide policy guidance regarding climate targets and justice because IAM bias is within the underlying modeling framework.This workshop aims at debunking what does not work with existing dominant modeling framework and to develop an outline for a new modeling approach that include a wider set of parameters to build momentum and push for alternative methods and models, which allows assessing in an open manner by all users i) the magnitudes of risks in different countries/regions associated with different concentrations of greenhouse gasses and the announced climate neutrality targets as well as ii) how these risks could be distributed across countries and generations considering the known deep uncertainties.The aim is to i) feed the next IPCC cycle by providing scenarios that reflect better the identified climate risks and their regional and intergenerational impacts and to allow for an open and realistic public debate about climate action, and to ii) identify researchers and institutions in the global South to build collaborations and capacity to empower IPCC focal points.</p>  <p> Welcome and opening   <br>   <br>09:00 – 09:05</p>  <p> Session I: Weaknesses and strengths of the dominant modeling frameworks and scenarios  <br>   <br>09:15 - 10:40</p>  <p> IAMs: The Emperor has no clothes </p>  <p>Moderator</p>  <p>   <br>IAMs: The Emperor has no clothes</p>  <p> The economics of immense risk </p>  <p>   <br>The economics of immense risk</p>  <p> Equity Assessment in Global Pathways in IPCC AR6 </p>  <p>   <br>Equity Assessment in Global Pathways in IPCC AR6</p>  <p> The cross-border risks of a global economy in mid-transition  </p>  <p>   <br>The cross-border risks of a global economy in mid-transition </p>  <p> LED - Motivation and main features </p>  <p>   <br>LED - Motivation and main features</p>  <p> IPCC Scenarios_From emissions to global temperatures </p>  <p>   <br>IPCC Scenarios_From emissions to global temperatures</p>  <p> Emissions Scenarios : what is needed for ESM simulations and why? </p>  <p>   <br>Emissions Scenarios : what is needed for ESM simulations and why?</p>  <p> Session II: Alternative modelling frameworks and scenarios: where do we stand?  <br>   <br>10:50 – 12:25</p>  <p> A societal transformation scenario for staying below 1.5°C </p>  <p>Moderator</p>  <p>   <br>A societal transformation scenario for staying below 1.5°C</p>  <p> Providing decent living standards with minimumenergy use </p>  <p>   <br>Providing decent living standards with minimumenergy use</p>  <p> Provisioning systems for a good life within planetary boundaries </p>  <p>   <br>Provisioning systems for a good life within planetary boundaries</p>  <p> A system dynamics based modelling framework </p>  <p>   <br>A system dynamics based modelling framework</p>  <p> A sustainable development pathway for climate action within the UN 2030 Agenda </p>  <p>   <br>A sustainable development pathway for climate action within the UN 2030 Agenda</p>  <p> Modeling transformational policy pathways on low growth and negative growth scenarios  </p>  <p>   <br>Modeling transformational policy pathways on low growth and negative growth scenarios </p>  <p> Justice and convergence in IAMs </p>  <p>   <br>Justice and convergence in IAMs</p>  <p> Integrated Assessment Modeling of post-growth scenarios </p>  <p>   <br>Integrated Assessment Modeling of post-growth scenarios</p>  <p> A new scenarios framework for equitable and climate-compatible futures </p>  <p>   <br>A new scenarios framework for equitable and climate-compatible futures</p>  <p> Session III: Round Table discussion on Requirements and outline for a new modeling framework   <br>   <br>14:45 – 16:45</p>
