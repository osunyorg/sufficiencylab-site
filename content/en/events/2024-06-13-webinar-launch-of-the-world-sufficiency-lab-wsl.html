        <p>Sufficiency was identified by the latest IPCC report on climate mitigation as a major pillar to decarbonise the global economy. However, sufficiency is overlooked in climate policies and modelling. </p><p>Against this background, the World Sufficiency Lab was established in February 2024 with the aim of mainstreaming the sufficiency concept at international, regional, and national levels. The ultimate target is to build a global sufficiency community that will ensure SUFFICIENCY is considered FIRST in policy and business decisions. </p><p>This webinar is the first of a series of webinars organised by the World Sufficiency Lab in collaboration with the World Resources Forum and hosted by Sciences Po’ Chair on Sustainable Development.</p>
