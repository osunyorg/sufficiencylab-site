    <p>Webinar Launch </p>  <p>https://vimeo.com/962950458?share=copy <br>WSL webinar launch</p>  <p> Background  <br>Sufficiency was identified by the latest IPCC report on climate mitigation as a major pillar to decarbonise the global economy. However, sufficiency is overlooked in climate policies and modelling. Against this background, the World Sufficiency Lab was established in February 2024 with the aim of mainstreaming the sufficiency concept at international, regional, and national levels. The ultimate target is to build a global sufficiency community that will ensure SUFFICIENCY is considered FIRST in policy and business decisions. </p>  <p>   <br>           <br>        </p>  <p>Register here <br>https://sciencespo.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5BIQuAWnRvq-qWedFE2MIQ#/registration</p>  <p> Welcome  <br>   <br>12:30 – 12:35</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>WSL co-founder</p>  <p> Keynote  <br>   <br>12:35 – 12:50 </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Climate Change Director at the French Ministry of the Energy Transition</p>  <p> Presentation of the WSL web platform and work programme by WSL team  <br>   <br>12:50 – 13:20</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>WSL co-founder</p>  <p>WSL co-founder and Urban Areas Programme Lead</p>  <p>Mobility Programme Lead</p>  <p>Clothing Programme Lead</p>  <p>Digitalisation Programme Lead</p>  <p> Round Table Discussion on regional/national sufficiency hubs  <br>   <br>13:20 – 13:50</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Moderator, Head of communications at World Resources Forum (Geneva, Switzerland)</p>  <p>Lord Mayor of Adelaïde (South Australia, Australia)</p>  <p>Leader of EU policy and Strategic Partnerships at Energy Cities (Brussels, Belgium)</p>  <p>Founder of Climate Strategy Works LLC, and a Senior Fellow with Architecture 2030 (Seattle, USA) </p>  <p>Director of the Energy Climate Policy Institute (ECPI) (Seoul, South Korea)</p>  <p> Q&A session  <br>   <br>13:50 – 13:55</p>  <p> Closing remarks  <br>   <br>13:55 – 14:00</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>WSL co-founder</p>  <p>WSL co-founder</p>
