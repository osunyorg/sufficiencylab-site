    <p>  <br>As ecological and social challenges intensify, sufficiency is shifting from the margins to the center of policy discussions. Join us for a  high-level roundtable  exploring how sufficiency can drive systemic change across Europe and beyond. With climate and resource crises escalating, sufficiency-reducing consumption through intentional, equitable strategies-has become a  key policy priority . This event brings together leading voices from  European institutions, national governments,  municipalities, academia, and civil society  to discuss its role in shaping governance and social transformation. From the  European Parliament  to grassroots innovations in the  social and solidarity  economy at the local level , the panel will examine how sufficiency can be integrated into public policy and urban practices. Speakers will explore mechanisms, levers, tensions, opportunities, and pathways for embedding sufficiency into decision-making and collective action. Panellists    -  Yvan Verougstraete , Member of European Parliament    -  Diane Simiu , Director at the French Ministry for the Ecological Transition    -  Dan Lert , Deputy Mayor of Paris in charge of Ecological Transition    -  Dr. Yamina Saheb , Lecturer/Researcher at Sciences Po, Director of  World  Sufficiency Lab Moderation:  Dr. Céline Cantat ,  CARE Program , Sciences Po Paris The roundtable is part of the first-ever Sufficiency Summer School co-organized by the  World Sufficiency Lab  and the  CARE Programme  on "Sufficiency in Practice" and is open to the public. It will be followed by a reception during which creative work on sufficiency by graduate and postgraduate students will be  exhibited .    </p>
