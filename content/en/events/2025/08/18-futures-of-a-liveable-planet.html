  summary: >-
    <p>This seminar invites participants to explore assumptions about the future of our shared habitat. Using the UNESCO methodology "Futures Literacy", participants will travel back and forth between imagined futures and present-day policy choices. The interactive setting challenges conventional thinking and empowers participants to rethink the boundaries of what makes our planet liveable.   </p>
