    <p>Sufficiency PhD Days  <br>   <br>The concept of  sufficiency  has deep philosophical roots, dating back to Ancient Greece. Its emergence as a modern academic framework, however, is more recent.  Philosopher  Harry Frankfurt  (1987)  reintroduced sufficiency as a  lower limit -the idea that everyone should have "enough" to live a decent life.Â TheÂ idea simultaneously gained traction in political science.  Laura Spengler  (2016)  was among the first to emphasize the need to integrate both  social and ecological thresholds  into policymaking.Â Expanding on this,Â  Liam Shields Â (2020) Â argued for a more complete conception that includes both aÂ  lower and upper limit : ensuring everyone has enough while recognizing that excessive consumption can be unjust and unsustainable.Â Â   This interdisciplinary evolution culminated in  Yamina Saheb's  (2021) widely cited definition:Â  "Sufficiency is a set of policy measures <br>and daily practices which avoid the demand for energy, materials, land, water, <br>and other natural resources, while delivering wellbeing for all within <br>planetary boundaries." This framing introduced the sufficiency corridorÂ in whichÂ  societal well-being is ensured without overshooting ecological boundaries.  Thus, moving Â  beyond abstract ideals to define a  clear and actionable space  where policies and practices can deliver a "good life for all "while maintaining environmental integrity. The importance of sufficiency was further recognized in the  IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report  (2022) , indicating a major step in embedding sufficiency into sustainability science. Despite growing momentum, recent applications of  sufficiency  often place disproportionate emphasis on  demand reduction , overlooking critical aspects of  social justice  and  basic well-being . Bridging this gap requires  interdisciplinary collaboration  that integrates  normative, technical, and empirical  perspectives. That is precisely the mission of the  Sufficiency PhD Days .Â Â </p>  <p> Connecting Sufficiency Minds: Mapping, Sharing, and Co-Creating  <br>   <br>The Sufficiency PhD Days  will bring together approximately  40 doctoral researchers  from diverse disciplines. Over two days, participants will:  <br> Present and discuss their research through papers and posters  <br> Map the current landscape of sufficiency-related studies  <br> Identify overlaps, gaps, and opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaboration  <br> Engage in roundtables and informal sessions to co-create future initiatives  <br> A  social evening event  is also being considered to foster informal exchange and strengthen the community spirit among participants.Â Â </p>  <p> ðŸŽ“ Calling all PhD students exploring sufficiency!  <br>Are you working on how societies can thrive within planetary boundaries; no matter your discipline? We're looking for doctoral researchers eager to connect, share, and shape the future of sufficiency studies. Join a vibrant, cross-disciplinary gathering that brings together perspectives from across the academic spectrum, including (but not limited to):  <br> Ecological and mainstream economics  <br> Political science and policy studies  <br> Environmental philosophy and ethics  <br> Urban, transport and building planning  <br> Physics, engineering and energy systems  <br> Sociology and behavioural sciences  <br> Formal and computational modelling, including AI  <br> The  Sufficiency PhD Days  are designed to be  inclusive ,  interdisciplinary , and  exploratory;Â  a space for connection, exchange, and inspiration across fields. Bring your research. Bring your curiosity. Be part of the conversation.</p>  <p> Application Process    <br>   <br>To apply, please submit your application  online  by July 21st, 2025. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the organizing team at: info@thesufficiencylab.org.Â Â </p>  <p> Note for the Contributors    <br>   <br>A joint proceedings report summarizing key insights and contributions from the event will be published by the  World Sufficiency Lab (WSL) .  Participants will also have the opportunity to contribute to the  WSL blog . The event will be held in a  hybrid format , though  in-person attendance is strongly encouraged  to foster deeper engagement and networking opportunities.
