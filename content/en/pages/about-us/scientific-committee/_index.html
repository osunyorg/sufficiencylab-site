        <p>The WSL Scientific Committee is composed of members of high scientific standing in sufficiency. Each member serves in an independent scientific capacity and does not represent countries or similar interests. </p><p>The Scientific Committee assists the WSL Founders in providing scientific advice and opinions on any scientific matter in the areas of work undertaken by the lab.  </p><p>The Scientific Committee has three major tasks:</p><ul>  <li>To deliver an      opinion on the WSL multiannual and annual work programme; </li>  <li>To give an opinion      to the founders for the purposes of recruitment of the lab's scientific      staff; </li>  <li>To provide advice      and/or opinion on any scientific matter concerning the lab's activity,      which the founders may submit to it. </li> </ul><p>        </p><p>To deliver on the above, and to discuss topics of mutual interest to support the work of the WSL, the Scientific Committee meets three times per year (online).</p>

        <p><b>Dr. Mashael Yazdanie</b> is a Group Leader of Macro-Energy Systems at the Urban Energy Systems Laboratory, Empa, Switzerland. With a background in engineering from the University of Waterloo, Canada (Systems Design Engineering) and ETH Zurich, Switzerland (Energy Science and Technology), she specializes in sustainable energy systems modeling and analysis. Her work includes applications in solar, ocean, wind, and biogas energy, electric mobility, carbon capture, decentralized generation, and urban energy systems planning – the latter two being the focus of her award-winning doctoral research at ETH Zurich. </p><p>Dr. Yazdanie has collaborated with diverse international organizations and research institutes on climate resilience and sustainability issues, addressing energy challenges within multidisciplinary teams across the Global North (Switzerland, Canada, and Germany) and Global South (Ghana, Pakistan, and China). Her recent transdisciplinary partnership with researchers in West Africa focused on advancing energy system planning models to enhance urban climate resilience in low- and middle-income countries. Mashael is a dedicated advocate for holistic, multifaceted approaches to tackling the climate crisis through multidisciplinary and international collaboration to co-create resilient, equitable, and sustainable societies.</p>
