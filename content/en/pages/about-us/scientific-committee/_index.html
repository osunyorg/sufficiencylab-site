        <p>The WSL Scientific Committee is composed of members of high scientific standing in sufficiency. Each member serves in an independent scientific capacity and does not represent countries or similar interests. </p><p>The Scientific Committee assists the WSL Founders in providing scientific advice and opinions on any scientific matter in the areas of work undertaken by the lab.  </p><p>The Scientific Committee has three major tasks:</p><ul>  <li>To deliver an      opinion on the WSL multiannual and annual work programme; </li>  <li>To give an opinion      to the founders for the purposes of recruitment of the lab's scientific      staff; </li>  <li>To provide advice      and/or opinion on any scientific matter concerning the lab's activity,      which the founders may submit to it. </li> </ul><p>        </p><p>To deliver on the above, and to discuss topics of mutual interest to support the work of the WSL, the Scientific Committee meets three times per year (online).</p>
