    A Legacy Within Reach: Why the EU Must Embrace Sufficiency
  summary: >-

    <p>  <br>Dear Mrs von der Leyen, In December 2019, five years ago, you declared your determination " to succeed for the good of this planet and the life it shelters" . You launched the  European Green Deal,  which became   the Commission's roadmap </p>  <p>for environmental and social transformation.  Its vision offered a glimmer of hope: climate neutrality by 2050, a fair transition, and the preservation of biodiversity. As you stated, it was  " the greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity of our time. ” Today, however, the situation is deeply alarming. </p>  <p>None of the Green Deal's targets are on track.  The  ESABCC  has highlighted critical shortcomings in the EU's climate neutrality efforts . According to the  EEA ,  “Europe’s nature is experiencing a serious and continuing decline (...) at an alarming rate.”  Six out of nine  planetary boundaries  have been crossed. Meanwhile,  disparities in living conditions between EU residents continue to widen .  We have already lost precious time. Continuing on this path, leaves no future for coming generations, no planet on which life can thrive. It is time to act with urgency and  make sufficiency the overarching principle of all European policy . Sufficiency is not only a solution; it is the foundation upon which a just, liveable future must be built.   « Sufficiency is a set of policy measures and daily practices which avoid the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources, while delivering wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries. »  This framing defines  a sufficiency corridor : bounded on one side by universal well-being, and on the other by the planetary boundaries. It offers a concrete path forward-socially fair and environmentally sound.   This principle will help fulfil the ambitions set for Europe in response to current and future challenges. Indeed, a society grounded in the principle of sufficiency would promote equality, resilience, collective well-being and would address environmental challenges.  A society grounded in sufficiency fosters  equality, resilience, and well-being , while directly addressing environmental degradation. It seeks to meet essential human needs sustainably, prioritizing  quality over quantity .    Sufficiency has the potential to significantly lower carbon emissions, ease pressure on natural ecosystems and resources, spur the transition toward a better use of natural resources, reduce climate-related costs in the long term and bridge social divides and promote equity.    If you enshrined sufficiency as a guiding principle,  Europe could become the first sustainable continent -and you, the leader who made it possible. This is not just a policy shift. It is a  legacy opportunity  to lay the foundation of a fairer, healthier and resilient European Union.   In closing, I appeal not only to your political leadership, but also to your heart as a mother.  Greta Thunberg's words still resonate:  “You say that you love your children above all, and yet you are stealing their future right before their eyes. Until you focus on what needs to be done, rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope.” </p>  <p>Mrs von der Leyen: The future begins with a single choice; make Sufficiency first. </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>  <p>   <br>Victoire Payer is a second-year master's student in Environmental Policy at the Paris School of International Affairs, where she specializes in European studies and biodiversity. She holds a bachelor's degree from Sciences Po, where she followed the Europe-North America program and spent a year abroad at the University of Montreal studying environmental policy in depth. Passionate about biodiversity conservation, Victoire has contributed to several organizations focused on raising awareness-particularly among children. She is currently completing an apprenticeship at the Urban Ecology Agency of the City of Paris. Next year, she aims to join the public sector or an NGO working on biodiversity protection and nature-based solutions.  </p>
