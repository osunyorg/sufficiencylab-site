    A Letter to the European Commission: Time for Sufficiency

    <p>  <br>Dear Madam President of the European Commission, Imagine humanity sharing a single cellar of vital resources.  Neoliberalism and overpopulation  are depleting it, while those in charge  profit from scarcity,  selling, trading and accumulating power, ignoring calls for moderation. These leaders  reject limits  that threaten their benefits, remaining in  denial  about the looping catastrophe.  Similarly,  climate change  intensifies disasters, disrupts ecosystems, worsens life on Earth. Yet, we remain in denial,  unable to act  on a long-term threat that required  proactive policies decades ago . It is time to  listen to those advocating for moderation; f or  sufficiency .   Sufficiency is both a set of policy measures and daily actions which avoid the demand for energy, materials, water, land and any other natural resources while delivering wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries .  It offers a safe space for future generations, breaking from growth-driven models to create prosperity centred on well-being .  Yet, citizens  struggle to make sufficiency choices due  to structural barriers. That is why  sufficiency has to become a systemic principle in the EU . It strengthens resilience,  lowers costs, boosts competitiveness  and helps achieve climate and energy targets while promoting  equity and quality of life . Thus, complementing  the EU Green Deal . Put simply,  sufficiency is a matter of life and death .   <br>Because  the future climate depends on choices we make today . And without action,  children born in 2020 won’t live longer enough to grow old .  As a  mother of a large family,  you understand  rigour and responsibility  more than many. We urge you to  step up for your European family . Because  you hold responsibility for my future as much as your grandchildren’s .  Because  we have only a few years left to mitigate the impacts of climate change .  This is not  just a personal plea, but  one backed by  European citizens.  Assemblies across  ten European countries  show  93% support for sufficiency  measures .  French citizens ranked sufficiency as their  top recommendation  in the  Convention on the Future of the EU . Meanwhile, the  IPCC reports a lack of measures to reduce demand ,  and  experts increasingly call for sufficiency strategies . Yet,  leaders have kept sufficiency absent from EU policy .   Now, it is your role to  plan and adapt accordingly .   <br>We urge you,  Madam President , to create the  first EU Sufficiency Strategy and Action Plan . The remaining time of your mandate offers a  historic opportunity  to place  sufficiency at the centre of EU policy;  leading to crucial  changes in these troubled times . We are  all counting on you .  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>  <p>   <br>Marion Bigoin holds  bachelor's degrees in Philosophy and Political Science  from  Panthéon-Sorbonne University  and is currently pursuing a  master's in Environmental Policy  at the  School of International Affairs, Sciences Po, Paris .  Passionate about  environmental and animal ethics , Marion advocates for a  respectful coexistence  between humans and the ecosystems they inhabit.  </p>
