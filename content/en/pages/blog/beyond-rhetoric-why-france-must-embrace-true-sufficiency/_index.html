    Beyond Rhetoric: Why France Must Embrace True Sufficiency

    <p>  <br>One might assume that France is at the forefront of implementing  sufficiency  within its policies. Indeed,  in a speech at Le Bourget Air Show on 19 June 2023, President Macron emphasized     a  "reasonable" and "common sense" sufficiency based on  "transparency" and without "punitive" measures . However, this interpretation fundamentally misrepresents the sufficiency concept. To effectively integrate  sufficiency  into France's political model, it is essential to return to its  scientific definition and core principles .   S ufficiency  as defined by  Saheb  and included in IPCC  2022  and  2023  reports is  "a set of policy measures and daily practices that avoid the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources, while delivering wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries."  This definition makes clear that sufficiency is not about  individual daily actions  ( petits gestes ), such as "turning off the light when leaving a room"-as President Macron urged in his speech.  Instead, sufficiency is deeply connected to  structural political and economic frameworks . Policies must apply  to all citizens -not through a blanket  "end of abundance" , as stated by President Macron in 2022, but through  equity-driven distributive justice . The goal is not to restrict resources indiscriminately, but to  raise minimum living standards while curbing overconsumption and environmental exploitation . Measures such as a"  'super-profit' tax  and  a universal basic income could be used to act on the  minimum and maximum thresholds of sufficiency , ensuring a fair and sustainable sufficiency model.   The true aim of sufficiency is  wellbeing -not mere restriction.  This concept aligns with  an eudaemonic    vision, focusing on meaning and self-realization. Integrating this perspective into  education and employment policies  could help resolve  France's work crisis , which has led to a  growing sense    of professional disenchantment and  of loss of meaning in work .   In other words, sufficiency is about reinventing the French model by moving away from  neoliberal principles Crucially, sufficiency requires a systemic change driven by  " planetary  boundaries "  approach , not a  "reasonable" small-scale reform . With  France condemned in 2021 and 2023 for climate inaction , sufficiency must be embedded within policy  assessments on environmental impact , particularly as we likely approach the alarming  +2.7°C temperature rise by 2050 .   To address this challenge, France must  embrace a global sufficiency policy -applicable across all sectors, from  urban planning to mobility and food systems . Encouragingly,  French public  confidence in sufficiency is growing , as reflected in  ADEME's transition scenarios , which incorporate sufficiency into  three of its four ecological pathways for 2050 . Now is the time to move beyond rhetoric and into  meaningful action . The future of sufficiency depends on  bold, systemic transformation-not just individual responsibility.</p>  <p> Jean Sabatier </p>  <p> </p>  <p>   <br>Jean Sabatier is a Master's student in Environmental Policy at Sciences Po Paris, currently completing an apprenticeship with the NGO Action Against Hunger for the French Mission. Prior to this, Jean graduated from ENSAE Paris (French National School of Statistics and Economics) and ENS de Lyon (Department of Geography). He has a strong interest in the intersection of environmental and social justice.  </p>
