    Beyond the Thermodynamic Wall: Why Sufficiency Must Drive Our Biomass Future

    <p>  <br>As <br>we confront the twin crisis of climate change and ecological collapse, one <br>inconvenient truth emerges from the deep archives of agricultural history: our <br>current uses of biomass (wood, crops, animal products, biowaste, algae etc.) <br>are fundamentally unsustainable, largely due to their dependence on fossil <br>fuels for energy and raw materials. Phasing out fossil fuels requires a profound transformation <br>in how we utilize biomass. While non-food applications will need to expand to <br>substitute petroleum-based products and molecules, a simple substitution won't <br>be enough as biomass availability is inherently limited. The solution lies in <br>embracing  sufficiency  by using biomass in ways that are  equitable, ecologically <br>sound, and restrained by planetary boundaries . </p>  <p> Before the Industrial Revolution, human societies relied on a solar metabolic <br>system governed by a flow logic: energy and material cycles were primarily <br>driven by the annual net primary production of sunlight. This system,  bounded <br>by thermodynamic limits , was fundamentally based on what nature could <br>produce in real time. The advent of the Industrial Revolution marked a profound <br>shift toward a  stock-based metabolism.  By harnessing fossil biomass, societies <br>overcome the thermodynamic limit by accessing vast stores of solar energy accumulated <br>over millions of years through photosynthetic activity of ancient plants and microorganisms. <br> This mining-based metabolic system replaced the flow logic with a stock logic, enabling exponential growth and transformation .    After <br>the World War II, the term ' agricultural product'  became virtually synonymous <br>with the term ' food product' .  A nutritional transition emerged, marked by a significant rise in the consumption of animal proteins at the expense of cereals . This shift was driven by an energy surplus enabled by the mining <br>metabolic regime.  The dramatic increase in agricultural yields and labour productivity, as well as the decline in non-food biomass uses, was made possible through the massive injection of fossil fuels into agriculture and the chemical industry .   In <br>a context where food autonomy had already been achieved and agriculture's <br>primary outlet became food production; this dynamic generated a persistent <br>problem of  overproduction.  One strategy to manage the surplus involved <br> subsidized exports and food aid  to countries in the Global South.  However, it was the deliberate " organized waste"  of biomass, through the expansion of  intensive livestock  farming and its  "cerealisation"  that played the most stabilizing role in cereal markets.  </p>  <p>Today's imperative</p>  <p>to  defossilize  compels a critical re-evaluation of biomass's role <br>in industrial processes. Non-food biomass is increasingly positioned as a <br>replacement for petroleum-derived materials across various sectors. Forests, <br>agricultural lands, and marine ecosystems offer essential feedstocks for <br>bio-based chemicals, materials, and energy. However, their supply cannot match <br>the scale or energy density of fossil resources. After all, coal, oil, and gas <br>represent the concentrated results of photosynthesis over geological <br>timescales. It is physically impossible to harvest equivalent amounts of <br>biomass. Any attempt at a  one-to-one substitution  would  collapse ecosystems  and <br>undermine  food security .       Recognizing <br>this "thermodynamic wall"  forces us to confront difficult choices about how we <br>allocate the limited biomass available to us. How much should go toward biofuels? <br>Which chemicals should be prioritized? How many cereals should be diverted to meat <br>production? These are the real-world questions where biomass sufficiency meets <br>political and ecological reality. To operationalize  biomass sufficiency , we must <br>establish  transparent, participatory democratic processes  where governments and <br>society can jointly define a  hierarchy of biomass uses  at both national and <br>local level. Institutionalizing this agreed-upon hierarchy will help navigate <br>competing demands, resolve resource conflicts, and protect the interests of <br>vulnerable communities.       Policies to operationalize biomass sufficiency include:   <br>  <br> </p>  <p>Diet shift : The livestock <br>sector remains the single largest consumer of global cropland.  By significantly cutting meat and dairy consumption, millions of hectares could be freed up to produce materials and platform chemicals . <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Development and Support <br>Non-Food Biomass Value Chains:  Farming practices should shift from <br>input-intensive monocultures to diversified, regenerative systems that yield <br>both food and non-food feedstock. In particular, the largely untapped potential <br>of the algae sector deserves strategic attention.   <br> Policymakers <br>can advance these goals using a mix of policy instruments and through  long-term <br>strategic planning .        <br> A review <br>of agricultural history reveals that phasing out fossil fuels will put <br>tremendous pressure on agroecosystems and natural ecosystems to supply industry <br>with biomass. Biomass will be required to replace certain uses of fossil fuels, <br>particularly in material applications for which no viable alternatives currently <br>exist.  Every ton reclaimed must be allocated wisely, with care and purpose. Against <br>this backdrop,  today's food system , characterized by high levels of animal <br>protein consumption, heavy reliance on ultra-processed foods, and significant <br>waste, stands out as a  historical anomaly . It is an energy-intensive and <br>health-compromising aberration, and a temporary luxury made possible only by <br>the extensive use of fossil fuels across all sectors of the economy. Consequently, <br>the phase-out of fossil fuels and the resulting shifts in biomass use will usher <br>in deep  societal transformations  that  must be collectively debated and deliberately shaped  to lead us toward a more <br>equitable and sustainable future.      </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>
