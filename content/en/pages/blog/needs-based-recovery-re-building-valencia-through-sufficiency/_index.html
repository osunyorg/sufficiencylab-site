    <p>Context  <br>   <br>València, the third-largest city in Spain, has been shaped by both neoliberal expansion and recent green leadership. From decades of development aimed at global visibility, elite profits and growth, hosting Formula 1, and America’s Cup, to more recent efforts under left-leaning party Compromís to reclaim space for people through pedestrianization and cycling infrastructure,[1] the city is now aiming to be a green leader, becoming European Green Capital in 2024.The October 2024 floods exposed the fragility of a neoliberal planning model centered on expansion and growth, with the floods causing major damages in flood-vulnerable areas built during the pre-crisis housing boom (see figure 1). Floods like this will only become more and more frequent in the coming years.[2] In response, a wave of solidarity networks emerged, but institutional reactions lag behind.</p>  <p> Figure 1: October 2024 Flood and newly constructed buildings [3] </p>  <p> Challenges  <br>   <br>València continues to face housing insecurity, overtourism, and ecological risk. Over 25% of residents own second homes[4] and growing tourist demand reduces housing availability for locals, especially the youth.[5]Furthermore, a 2019 municipal survey identified economic insecurity and weak social connection as key barriers to happiness.[6]  This matters in a collectivist society like València, where festivals, street gatherings, and family networks are vital to wellbeing.These challenges suggest policy is not meeting societal needs. The post-flood moment presents a chance to redefine local progress, while tackling the ecological crisis through housing policy.</p>  <p> Solutions  <br>   <br>A sufficiency approach offers an equity-based alternative deeply aligned with Valencian identity. Defined as a set of policies and practices that avoid unnecessary resource use while delivering wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries,[7] sufficiency centres needs satisfaction over accumulation. </p>  <p> The upper limits: Avoiding unnecessary resource use  <br>A sufficiency approach suggests setting ecological and social upper limits to housing policy by first, redistributing, rethinking and retrofitting existing buildings making the most of the current housing stock; then regulating short-term rentals and second-home ownership, broadening the homes available for long-term tenancies and lastly, introducing sufficiency criteria in urban planning, making sure all new projects satisfy real needs.</p>  <p> The lower limits: Meeting needs  <br>Max-Neef’s theory of fundamental human needs[8] highlights that progress doesn’t require endless consumption, but culturally relevant satisfiers.
