    <p>  <br>Overconsumption have long been <br>a huge problem in the global North. “We <br>live on a finite planet that cannot support endless growth and unequitable, <br>unchecked consumption”, Jennifer Molidor, Senior Food Campaigner <br>at the Center for Biological Diversity, recently warned. “The pressure to <br>constantly consume is driving destructive resource extraction, pollution and <br>waste, and contributing to the climate and extinction crises.”Overconsumption <br>is arguably related to the hegemonic idea that individuals should be understood as critical, <br>independent, and ultimately sovereign consumers able to dictate economic production and drive <br>political activity by choosing between available products on the market. This <br>idea causes overconsumption by rewarding consumerism and promoting growth. <br>Moreover, it disregards ideals about the redistribution of income and wealth in <br>pursuit of societal equality. Forming part of the ubiquitous neoliberal <br>political paradigm, the idea of consumer sovereignty is mainly interested in <br>safeguarding free consumer choice.Historically, <br>consumers and <br>consumption have been framed and politicized for many other societal frameworks <br>and goals. To mention some examples from the American context:In the interwar <br>era, New Deal reformers launched the ideal of the citizen consumer as an ideal that would secure the rights of <br>individual consumers in the face of unsafe products, unfair pricing, and <br>misleading advertising. The citizen consumer invoked a vision of the new <br>American democracy based on the popular mobilization of consumers in <br>cooperatives and movements, with consumers also represented in federal advisory <br>boards and agencies and supported by a state-regulated welfare economy.And <br>in response to how the growth- and consumption-oriented postwar economy threatened <br>to destroy the environment, in <br>the 1960s, social movements sought <br>to reduce <br>the sale, use, or manufacture of products that they considered harmful to the <br>ecological system. Next to pressuring government and business to change <br>production patterns, they promoted more responsible individual consumption <br>practices and lifestyles to improve the environment.However, <br>since the 1970s, the neoliberal paradigm has gained supremacy. Its breakthrough <br>was aided by the parallel ascendance of neoclassical theory within economics. This <br>theory builds on a notion <br>of the market as a realm of freedom, choice, and reason wherein rational agents <br>can realize their wants and desires. The market is thus understood as a site <br>for the maximization of individual interest rather than an arena devoted to the <br>search of public interest.Moreover, <br>it treats environmental destruction as a correctible <br>market failure, which can be fixed through carbon taxes, cap and trade, and <br>other flexible mechanisms. This is also a premise for the agenda of green <br>growth that has emerged as an off-shot of neoliberalism <br>and which claims that improving <br>the environment and securing economic growth can coincide.From the perspective of green growth, limiting ever-increasing <br>production and consumption is not a priority. Environmental problems are <br>to be fixed with technological solutions, so that people can still get as much <br>as they want.</p>  <p>Hence, <br>if we want to address overconsumption and its neglect of the principles of sufficiency, it is necessary to challenge the neoliberal paradigm <br>and its idea of consumer sovereignty.</p>  <p>  Neoliberalism replaces the citizen with the consumer — pushing people out of political life and into the marketplace. <br>Niklas Olsen</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>
