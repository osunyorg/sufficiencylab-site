    <p>  <br>Sufficiency  is a  competitive advantage ,  not a constraint . By embedding across all EU policies, Europe can guarantee  well-being for all , long-term  stability  and  social fairness  amid   growing geopolitical and environmental pressures. Making sufficiency the cornerstone of Europe’s sustainable future and its signature on the global stage.  Sufficiency avoids demand for natural resources, lowering risks tied to supply chain disruptions, price volatility, and geopolitical uncertainty. It's especially critical for  energy, food and critical minerals .   Demand for energy and materials can be avoided upfront  through  green roofs  or  safe cycling infrastructure,  while meeting citizens'  needs  for comfort and mobility.   S ufficiency  is essential for meeting the Union's  Economic Security Strategy   goals and achieving  Open Strategic Autonomy.  Sufficiency also boosts European's  economic competitiveness  by supporting business models rooted in  durability, and repairability.  Overconsumption benefits producers in low-cost countries, not European businesses. Unlike the  Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive , often criticized for mitigating harmful models, sufficiency proactively  enables sustainable alternatives , where environmental legislation becomes a catalyst, not a constraint.  </p>  <p>The European Commission's Green Deal was a bold response to scientific warnings on climate. </p>  <p>Yet, its implementation faces mounting challenges, and calls for simplification grow louder. Environmental concerns alone no longer drive climate action across Member States.  Sufficiency offers a science-based solution,  addressing not only climate change but all  nine planetary boundaries. At its core, sufficiency means  doing well with less , not through deprivation and sacrifice, but by enabling for a societal organization that fosters social, eudemonic and economic well-being  within the planet's limits . It implies avoiding demand upfront for energy, materials, land, water and other natural resources, before seeking efficiency gains that trigger rebound effects. With sufficiency policies like  shifting investments  from car-centric infrastructures to walkable cities, the green transition becomes aspirational, not burdensome.  This societal model aligns progress with both planetary boundaries and EU strategic imperatives.  Finally, sufficiency ensures a  fair and inclusive transition,  lowering costs, especially for low-income households. It's about  enabling  sustainable choices through the right infrastructures, rather than compensating for the fallout of an unfair transition (e.g., carbon pricing). Reducing the need for such compensation makes policy more cost-effective. By promoting a "Good Life" centred on well-being, and empowerment, sufficiency fosters  optimism and civic resilience,  vital at a time when   t he rule of law and democratic values  are under pressure across and beyond the EU. </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>  <p>   <br>Lucile Mabilais  is a Master's student in Environmental Policy at Sciences Po, specializing in the ecological transition of the agriculture and food sector.
