    Sufficiency and French National Politics: A Path Toward Resilience

    <p>  <br>The severe threats to Earth livable conditions demand change in France's ecological transition policies. Despite the potential of sufficiency to contribute at least 40% of the targeted 50% energy demand reduction in Europe by 2050 (without relying on unproven technologies), French policymakers have yet to fully embrace it. The government promotes an “ecology based on sciences”, yet without neglects the social dimensions of the transition, advancing anti-ecological projects and remains locked into growth imperatives, contrary to scientific recommendations, and the principles for enabling sufficiency framework. However, this trajectory can still shift. To align with sufficiency as defined by Saheb and included in the 2022 IPCC climate mitigation report France must develop a more comprehensive plan that goes beyond efficiency. Embracing sufficiency would offer the most rationale and accessible measures to reduce environmental impact in the short term.  This requires expanding the scope by introducing stronger measures, setting higher emissions' reduction targets (the current efforts only reach 60% reductions from a more ambitious scenario) and considering sufficiency principles beyond the energy sector.Progressive energy transition scenarios aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal to integrate sufficiency as enhanced efficiency and renewable energy alone are not enough and can present societal challenges. Nuclear energy, a cornerstone of current French policies, faces significant delays, rising costs, and uncertainties regarding plants operating in a warming climate. Furthermore, materials essential for renewable energy infrastructure (metals, biomass...) come with environmental and social consequences that must be addressed.Sufficiency could strengthen France’s sovereignty and autonomy by reducing fossil fuels (50% of energy consumption) and uranium import, both vulnerable to geopolitical fluctuations. Additionally, it would improve the country's trade balance, a key priority for French policymakers.The sufficiency approach promoted by the French government places the burden entirely on consumers, without any distinction. This contradicts academic literature, which underscores the need for structural government measures to enable lifestyle change, as individual agency is limited and shaped by socioeconomic factors.  Advocating for sufficiency at the international level, where it could become a key factor in geopolitical power offers France a unique opportunity to lead and position itself as a pioneer in sustainable policymaking. It can achieve this by driving societal change and shifting citizens’ lifestyles debunking the green growth myth, and promoting material sufficiency instead of overabundance - a concept already referenced in French political discourse.  Indicators must shift towards metrics rooted in health, education, food securing and culture, fostering the achievement of wellbeing for all. These are key aspects strengths of Welfare State that should be reinforced and embraced with pride, as GDP fails to capture the co-benefits of  climate and sufficiency policies.Sufficiency, though currently met with defiance, has the potential to inspire new imaginaries, rooted in eudaimonism and anchored in an alternative vision for the country built on values, strategy and enabling conditions. Through collective decision-making, reduced advertising pressure, reimagining territorial development, and informed citizen engagement, it could foster greater social acceptance.Sufficiency must be subject to political reflection, focusing on the equitable distribution of resources. A deep profound transformation of all sectors through exemplary public leadership, new planning approaches, clear trajectories, and effective monitoring , a broader structural shift would enable sufficiency policies to drive the ecological transition.By embracing sufficiency, political decision-makers can exercise their power wisely, fostering a more sustainable and just society.  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>
