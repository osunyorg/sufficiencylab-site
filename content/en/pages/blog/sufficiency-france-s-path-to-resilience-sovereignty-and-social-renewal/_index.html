    Sufficiency: France’s Path to Resilience, Sovereignty, and Social Renewal
  summary: >-

    <p>  <br>France, Europe, and the world, are facing a convergence of  unprecedented crises .  First, an  ecological crisis .  Six of the nine planetary boundaries have already been transgressed , leading to escalating consequences: extreme weather events, and also  the loss of vital ecosystem services that underpin our economy, from food to industrial production . Second, a  social crisis : as trust in institutions erodes, people lose faith in the ability of existing institutions to be just, protect them or to offer them brighter perspectives. Consequently,  populist and extreme parties are gaining ground, election after election . Third, a  crisis of the international order , marked by escalating conflicts, global fragmentation, and growing uncertainty in international relations. Addressing these crises requires more than incremental reforms - it demands a paradigm shift, to break free from neoliberal constraints.  Sufficiency , defined as  “a set of  policy measures  and  daily practices  which avoid the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources, while delivering  well-being for all  within  planetary boundaries ” , is the only viable way forward. France has begun exploring this path, with a national energy sufficiency plan launched in 2022 . Yet,  it remains largely focused on efficiency measures and individual behavioural changes , failing to address the  systemic transformation  that sufficiency truly requires.  As the saying goes,  “while efficiency is about doing things right, sufficiency is about doing the  right things ” .  Both are necessary, but  sufficiency must come first . Sufficiency is not Sacrifice. It's about Systemic Freedom   for all . Doing the right things without being judgmental implies acknowledging the  social structure  shaping individual choices, including infrastructures, institutions and social norms.   Individuals make decisions within a given context, that influences their individual freedom . By modifying this context, sufficiency shifts the conversation  away from sacrifices and restrictions . Instead, sufficiency creates  new freedoms  - where sufficient behaviours become obvious, practical, desirable and attractive, where public transport eliminates the need for personal cars and durable, repairable products become the norm. Sufficiency is the condition for  sovereignty and resilience.  France and Europe lack many natural resources domestically . Sufficiency strengthens sovereignty by reducing its imports and increasing resilience against external shocks such as wars and trade instability.  Policies that promote product longevity and repair have already been proven to relocate jobs and value chains domestically , boosting local economies.  Ultimately, sufficiency is an opportunity to  rebuild a new long-lasting  social contract ,  one rooted in  well-being,  equity and protection  of those affected by the transition .  The  sufficiency social contract  will create new avenues for  meaning  and  purpose ,  autonomy  and  accomplishment , as well as  security  and  fairness  for all.  France  has always been a nation of  visionaries . In this pivotal moment of ecological and social urgency, France has the opportunity to lead Europe by embedding  sufficiency  at the heart of public policy. Not as a constraint or a renunciation, but as a  path to well-being, prosperity, sovereignty, resilience, and justice.</p>  <p> Marine Bernicot </p>  <p>Marine <br>Bernicot  is a graduated engineer from Ecole Centrale de Lyon.
