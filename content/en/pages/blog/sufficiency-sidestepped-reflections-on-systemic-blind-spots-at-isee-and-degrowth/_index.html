    Sufficiency Sidestepped: Reflections on Systemic Blind Spots at ISEE & Degrowth

    <p>  <br>At the  2025 ISEE & Degrowth Conference  in <br>Oslo, sufficiency made a visible appearance; with 7 out of 253 sessions and 1 <br>out of 7 plenaries devoted to the concept. Yet for all the attention, one thing <br>became clear:  sufficiency  remains dramatically  underdeveloped as a <br>theory of justice and a political strategy for systemic transformation.  <br>  <br>One encouraging trend is the broadening of <br>sufficiency beyond its familiar energy-centric framing. Unlike much of the <br>sustainability science literature that treats "energy sufficiency" as a <br>companion to efficiency, discussions in Oslo signalled a growing recognition:  sufficiency means avoiding unnecessary resource demand of all kinds from the outset.  It's not just about how we use energy, but how we relate to materials, time, <br>and space. And ultimately, to one another. <br>  <br>Moreover, the link between  sufficiency, <br>needs, and well-being  was acknowledged in several sessions; both in <br>conceptual work and in some modelling efforts. But this thread was not <br>consistently picked up, nor translated into actionable frameworks. Sufficiency <br>remained, largely, a discourse  about  consumption. <br>  <br>Rooted in consumption research, many sessions <br>approached sufficiency through critiques of consumerism or concepts like <br> consumption corridors . While this lens is valuable, it often defaults to a <br>narrative of  individual restraint , sidelining structural conditions and <br>collective agency. Yet sufficiency, at its core, asks us to  reimagine the <br>social and economic systems that generate excessive demand in the first place . <br>  <br>Where were the policy proposals? The business <br>models? The legal pathways? Few sessions ventured beyond analysis to discuss <br>sufficiency as a basis for regulation or redistribution. There were scattered <br>references to reducing meat and air travel, and a welcome reflection on housing <br>provision. But overall, the conference missed the chance to position <br>sufficiency as a  governance principle ,  not just a lifestyle choice. <br>  <br>Macroeconomic modelling communities similarly <br>struggled to integrate sufficiency and address how it could meet needs or <br>reduce poverty. Many relied on exogenous reductions in economic activity or <br>optimal carbon pricing, despite robust critiques of their regressive <br>distributional effects. These tools are grounded in neoclassical assumptions.  </p>  <p>All of this points to a deeper distinction <br>between  degrowth  and  sufficiency . While degrowth is an economic <br>critique aimed at reducing material throughput,  sufficiency is rooted in philosophical traditions of fairness, moderation, and ecological ethics.  It <br>offers not just a critique of excess, but a proactive blueprint for enough.</p>  <p>But for sufficiency to fulfil that promise, it <br>must move from the margins to the core, from scattered sessions to a strategic anchor. </p>  <p>It must be viewed not merely as a behavioural strategy, but as a  framework <br>for governance, planning, and justice.  <br>  <br>The door is open. Let's not just talk about <br>sufficiency. Let's start designing with it.      </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>
