    Sufficiency: Where Philosophy Meets Science
  summary: >-
    <p>By Yamina Saheb </p><p>2025-01-31  </p>

    <p>  <br>“Sufficiency is a set of policy measures and daily practices which avoid the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources while delivering well-being for all within planetary boundaries.” In an era of escalating geopolitical and <br>ecological crises, sufficiency offers a pathway to a more balanced and <br>harmonious existence, enriched by the moral clarity provided by philosophers. Sufficiency is deeply rooted in philosophy. <br>Harry Frankfurt's essay  "Equality as a Moral Ideal"  provides a <br>compelling lens through which to view sufficiency. Frankfurt argues that <br>economic equality is not of paramount moral importance. Instead, what truly <br>matters is that everyone has enough to lead a decent life. Three decades later,  Liam Shields  proposed a <br>more nuanced approach, suggesting that while ensuring everyone has enough is <br>crucial, the distribution of resources beyond this threshold should not be <br>entirely disregarded. This perspective integrates the idea of  a lower limit  <br>(ensuring everyone has enough) with considerations about  the upper limit  <br>(how resources are distributed beyond the lower limit). The ethical framing of sufficiency in <br>philosophy suggests considering  sufficiency corridors  to <br>deliver justice and a good life for all without overshooting the planet’s <br>ecological limits. Sufficiency corridors combine the ethical principles of <br>sufficiency with scientific insights about ecological boundaries. These <br>corridors challenge mainstream economics' focus on the sovereign consumer and <br>its emphasis on nudges, behavioral change, and preferences. Earth science advocates for the   planetary boundaries’ framework , within which humanity should operate to keep the <br>planet livable for future generations. This framework allows operationalizing <br>the philosophical upper limit of sufficiency while the lower limit is about the <br>fulfillment of fundamental human needs. Unlike current policies, sufficiency <br>focuses on human needs satisfiers rather than on objects. It builds on  eudaimonic well-being , which emphasizes societal well-being and long-term <br>sustainability within planetary boundaries, fostering a sense of purpose, <br>community, and environmental stewardship. In  "The Logic of Sufficiency,"  Thomas <br>Princen defines sufficiency as  an organizing principle  that offers a <br>compelling alternative to the dominant efficiency-driven model. Princen argues <br>for prioritizing sufficiency over efficiency to address the environmental and <br>economic challenges of the 21st century. He discusses how sufficiency can serve <br>as an organizing principle for society, involving doing well with enough <br>resources, promoting good governance, and ensuring long-term sustainability. <br>This perspective requires a fundamental shift from the mainstream economic <br>model, which emphasizes profit maximization, behavior change, and efficiency, <br>towards a sufficiency economy driven by a practical approach to living well <br>within limits. Returning to philosophy and the roots of  practice theory  to identify how sufficiency could help organizing our societies <br>within sufficiency corridors. Practice theory emphasizes the importance of <br>everyday practices, routines, and the ways in which  individuals are embedded <br>in social and material contexts . Integrating practice theory with the <br>organizing principle of sufficiency offers a comprehensive framework for <br>addressing the complex challenges of sustainability. Embodiment can deepen our <br>understanding of how sufficiency is practiced in daily life.  Indeed, our practices are not just about making <br>conscious and rational choices, as mainstream economics suggests. Instead, our choices <br>are embodied in routines and habits and shaped by materiality. The design of <br>products, buildings, and infrastructure heavily influences how our needs are <br>satisfied. Practice theory helps us understand the complex interactions between <br>individuals, communities, and their environments. This approach can reveal how <br>social norms, cultural values, and community practices shape our daily lives. <br>Addressing these relational dynamics fosters a culture of sufficiency supported <br>by social networks and community engagement. Practice theory helps to find ways to make sufficiency more  intuitive  and integrated into daily life. </p>  <p> Sufficiency <br>transcends being merely a theoretical concept; it effectively bridges <br>philosophical ideals with scientific pragmatism. It focuses on thriving within <br>ecological limits rather than on denial or sacrifice. Given the global <br>ecological constraints, sufficiency emerges as an  ethical necessity , urging us <br>to reevaluate our values and prioritize long-term sustainability for all over immediate <br>benefits for the few. </p>
