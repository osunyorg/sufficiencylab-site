    Sufficiency: Will Austria take the lead or fall behind?

    <p>  <br>Dear Chancellor Stocker,    Your party is currently negotiating key topics for the next legislative period. In the past, your decisions have failed to adequately address the urgency of climate change. Hence, I urge you to stop making climate-blind policies that jeopardize our future. The Climate Crisis is no longer a distant, abstract threat. It is here, tangible and drastically accelerating, ignoring it is highly irresponsible.  Surface temperatures have risen faster in the  past five decades than ever before in human history.  The frequency and intensity of heat  waves, floods, droughts and wildfires is unprecedented .   Austria is not immune,  its temperature is rising faster than the global average, glaciers are disappearing and  permafrost is melting .  The costs of climate inaction already  amounting to  €7 billion annually  and will increase dramatically due to growing  frequencies of devastating extreme weather events and potential EU penalties if Austria fails to meet its  climate targets The question is therefore not whether we should act, but  how . Our growth-obsessed, market-driven economy is the result of specific economic ideas and strategic policy interventions, it is neither natural nor inevitable.  It reduces people from  citizens to consumers, prioritizing profit over human and planetary well-being . This system has been  constructed,  and therefore, it can also be  reconstructed  and rebuilt into a system centred around sufficiency. Sufficiency is not about deprivation, but about  smarter, more sustainable policies  that protect us from deprivation and scarcity. It is a framework that aligns our economic and social institutions with wellbeing and the planetary boundaries.  Its core principle is  ‘enough’,   ensuring that everyone can live a good life within our ecological limits, while embracing the idea of  “ living well on less” .  Sufficiency  challenges our current, neoliberal,  consumer-driven understanding of prosperity,   replacing  quantity with quality  and e xcess with balance . Public policy is a critical starting point as it plays a significant role in incentivizing overconsumption and ecological degradation through subsidizing fossil fuels, factory farming and unsustainable infrastructure.  Tax money is currently being used to undermine  the foundations of our future .  Sufficiency-oriented policies  can reverse this trend by redirecting resources to meaningful social institutions, including  health, care, education and healthy ecosystems . Sufficiency is not an unrealistic, utopian ideology, but a  strategic policy framework, a compass  guiding us toward stability and prosperity in a resource-constrained world. What does sufficiency look like in practice? It is simple:  set upper limits  on per person living space in new buildings,  introduce heating and cooling thresholds,   stop the expansion  of carbon-intensive infrastructure, halt the expansion of urban sprawl.  Ban advertisements  for high-emission goods such as SUVs or fast fashion.  Regulate messaging  that promotes planetary and societal harm.   Ending  long-overdue  fossil  fuel   subsidies  and  shift toward a local, plant-based food system . As a high-ranking policymaker, you are in a  unique, powerful position  to initiate this shift and show the world what  sustainable, progressive and responsible leadership  looks like.  The question is: Will Austria take the lead or fall behind ? The time to act is now.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>  <p>   <br>Sophie Seiser is a master's student in Environmental Policy at Sciences Po in Paris. Her academic interests lie at the intersection of climate change, sustainability, and economic policy. She holds a B.Sc. in Business and Economics from the Vienna University of Economics and Business, where she specialized in finance and sustainability. Her thesis analysed the impacts of fiscal and monetary responses to the 2007-2008 financial crisis on wealth and income inequality in the United States. Professionally, Sophie is contributing to the  CARE programme's  research project at Sciences Po focused on sufficiency in urbanization. She has also gained experience at the European Green Deal Unit of the Energy Community, where she analysed renewable energy developments. Sophie's current interests include ecological economics, climate governance, sustainable urban development, and policies that enable equitable socioeconomic transitions while remaining within planetary limits  </p>
