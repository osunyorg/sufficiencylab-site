    Too Radical to Model? Why Climate Science Sidesteps Justice

    <p>  <br>Last week,  the third Scenario Forum  was held at the University of Leeds, a gathering where researchers shape the climate futures that will inform the world' s most influential global assessment reports:  the  IPCC  and  IPBES . Behind the scenes, one thing became clear: the  models  designed to envision our collective future are  still failing to include the radical change  needed to keep the planet liveable for today’s and future generations.  This year’s forum expanded on advancing the use of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)-Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) framework that underpin IPCC modelling, and included exploration of the transformative potential of scenarios that address health, inform policy and open-up new possibilities for the future, ahead of the next  Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project  (CMIP7). There was even talk of rebranding the long-confusing RCPs under the simpler label  “climate dimension”. But, let’s be:  cosmetic modifications can’t fix the deep conceptual tensions baked into the SSP-RCP framework used by the IPCC.  Behind these acronyms lies a persistent problem:  large Economy-Environment models don’t model justice  . They cannot show what a world deliberately organized around equity (between and within countries, generations, or communities) might look like. This omission is all the more striking given that the IPCC’s own  AR7 chapter outline  explicitly mandates an exploration of “the relationship(s) between  equity, justice, and mitigation across, between and within countries and generations ”. Yet when forum organizers were pressed on how they would incorporate equity into their modelling, the response was sobering, revealing that these critical dimensions remain on the margins of the so-called IPCC climate scenarios. Let that sink in. Calls for  justice, redistribution, or systems change  are  not debated,  they are simply dismissed. “ Perfect equity scenarios do not exist, ” said one participant. “ Equity and mitigation are orthogonal goals , ” claimed another. And for colleagues working on  post-growth pathways , the message was blunt: “ too unrealistic .” This kind of reasoning preserves the SSP-RCP structure by sidelining anything too transformative. Equity is treated not as a modelling dimension, but as a philosophical afterthought. As Kanitkar, Mythri and Jayaraman argued in their  2024 assessment  :  " Integrated Assessment Models predict inequality not because it's inevitable, but because they refuse to model anything else" .  The IPCC claims, based on its  mandate , to be policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive. But that’s a myth. In practice, what gets modelled is what gets considered politically plausible, and what is left out of modelling shapes real-world action. As one speaker aptly pointed out during the opening plenary: " the IPCC effectively prescribes what is considered possible" .  </p>  <p> IPCC  reports are  performative ; they  don’t just reflect futures, they manufacture them  and  shape public discourse, policymaking, and real-world outcomes . Excluding upfront equity because it’s “unrealistic” is to deny its very possibility. Equity is not an analytical choice. It is a political and ethical one.  If realism is the bar, then let’s use it consistently. Carbon Dioxide Removal  (CDR)  technologies like B ECCS and Direct Air Capture , routinely feature in the so-called IPCC scenarios, despite their technico-financial implausibility, lack of social acceptance and ecological risks. The  myth of decoupling GDP growth from emissions  has been </p>  <p>thoroughly</p>  <p>debunked, yet it still underpins the global climate mitigation scenarios considered in IPCC assessment reports. Meanwhile, equitable post-growth models are cast out. The real question for the IPCC to answer is: whose realism, and whose future, will AR7 represent?  Ironically, the IPCC was described at the forum as primarily a “literature review exercise”. Meanwhile, IPBES, the biodiversity focused sibling institution, was praised for “doing research” via analytical frameworks. If that’s the case, then why are transformative, peer-reviewed pathways left out of IPCC modelling work?  The answer may lie in the authorship concentration. The IPCC is dominated by institutions and researchers from a handful of Western countries. If its role is to synthesize global knowledge, it must diversify its sources and frameworks or risk turning the modelling exercise into a performative ritual of consensus rather than a tool for planetary survival.  If the IPCC’s scenario architecture is to live up to its mandate, it must open-up to  equity , post-growth, to new imaginaries of  sufficiency  and care. This means  no longer outsourcing “justice ” to the  footnotes . It means embracing the scientific plurality of our times. And let’s be clear, this  transformation is not optional. It is necessary.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>
