    <p>  <br>In the summer of 2025, Norway, which is among the world's <br>wealthiest petrostate hosted a remarkable sequence of sustainability-related events: the  EAERE Annual Meeting  in Bergen, the  SoMaTPhD School  in Trondheim, the  Sufficiency and Beyond  workshop,  and <br>the  ISEE & Degrowth Conference  in Oslo. These gatherings, spanning <br>hundreds of papers and thousands of participants, represented a rich mix of <br>traditions including ecological economics, degrowth, and socio-material <br>transformation; all united in their pursuit of one essential question:  how can <br>societies flourish within planetary boundaries?  <br>  <br>From the perspective of sufficiency and the <br>Global South, a more sobering question also emerges:  What happens when the <br>conversation on living well within limits takes place in a petrostate and this <br>context goes unexamined?  <br>  <br>Norway's sovereign wealth, infrastructure, and <br>political influence are underpinned by fossil fuel exports. Yet, this <br>paradox, fossil-fuelled prosperity alongside climate leadership, was rarely <br>acknowledged. </p>  <p>What does it mean to imagine futures amid ongoing oil and gas expansion? The silence reflects a missed opportunity for deeper reflection</p>  <p>  <br>The term  sufficiency  featured across <br>events, but its depth and framing varied. In many sessions, it was cast as <br>sustainable consumption or modest lifestyle change, conversations with merit <br>yet often detached from sufficiency's more transformative potential. Rarely was <br>it treated as a  systemic governance principle: one that actively avoids resource demand while delivering well-being for all within planetary boundaries.  <br>  <br>This structural understanding of <br>sufficiency, which is central to lived realities in much of the Global South, was largely <br>absent. When sufficiency is reduced to personal choice, its  justice-oriented foundation  risks being lost.</p>  <p>Still, there were moments of insight and <br>critique.  Speakers from Colombia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, and India challenged <br>dominant framings. Panels on ecologically <br>unequal exchange offered compelling alternatives. But these perspectives, while <br>present, often remained peripheral. Epistemologies from the South were <br>referenced, not co-anchored. Petrostate dynamics were acknowledged only in <br>passing, if at all. And while concepts like  Sumak Kawsay   or  Ubuntu  <br>were invoked, they did not structurally shape the framing of transformation. <br>  <br>If " living well within limits " is to evolve <br>into a robust scientific, ethical, and policy framework, it must confront <br>its own conditions of possibility. This includes re-examining who sets the <br>agenda, how privilege manifests in academic and policy spaces, and what kinds <br>of change we are truly willing to entertain. <br>  <br>This shift calls for courage over comfort and for <br>aligning rhetoric with structure.  Sufficiency , fully embraced, asks us <br>to  move beyond metrics into meaning:  to build relationships across <br>geographies, generations, and worldviews that are grounded in  equity and care . <br>In the tensions we hesitate to name, we may find the roots of real <br>transformation.      </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Author</p>
