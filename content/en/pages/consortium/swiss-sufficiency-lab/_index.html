    <p>About  <br>   <br>The Swiss Sufficiency Lab (SSL)  is Switzerland's national hub for reimagining how we live, work, and thrive within planetary boundaries. More than a research initiative, it is a growing movement that unites researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and citizens to make  sufficiency  a practical and inspiring lever for sustainable transformation. As part of the global  World Sufficiency Lab's Sufficiency 1st Consortium,  the SSL connects Switzerland to an international community of pioneers who are testing and scaling sufficiency strategies across diverse contexts. Together, these labs exchange knowledge, pilot projects, and stories of change, building a collective momentum that turns sufficiency from a niche idea into a shared pathway driven by equity and justice. By fostering collaboration across sectors and borders, the SSL aims to unleash imagination and action: co‑creating solutions that reduce demand, enhance well‑being, and demonstrate that thriving societies can flourish within ecological limits.   SSL is a non-profit association created in July 2025 in Zürich and hosted at  Urban Energy Systems Laboratory at Empa</p>  <p> Call to action  <br>   <br>A dynamic alliance of researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and citizens is coming together through the Swiss Sufficiency Lab, a space to exchange bold ideas, share lived experiences, and co‑design pathways toward a sustainable and flourishing Switzerland. Very soon, we will launch an online platform for collaboration and dialogue. This will be your opportunity to connect, contribute, and actively shape Switzerland's growing sufficiency movement.
