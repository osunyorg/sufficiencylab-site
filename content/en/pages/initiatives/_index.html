        <p><i>“Sufficiency is a set of policy measures and daily practices that avoid the demand for energy, materials, land, water, and other natural resources while delivering well-being for all within planetary boundaries.”</i></p><p>In an era of escalating geopolitical and ecological crises, sufficiency offers a pathway to a more balanced and harmonious existence, enriched by the moral clarity provided by philosophers.</p><p>Sufficiency is deeply rooted in philosophy. Harry Frankfurt's essay "Equality as a Moral Ideal" provides a compelling lens through which to view sufficiency. Frankfurt argues that economic equality is not of paramount moral importance. Instead, what truly matters is that everyone has enough to lead a decent life.</p><p>Three decades later, Liam Shields proposed a more nuanced approach, suggesting that while ensuring everyone has enough is crucial, the distribution of resources beyond this threshold should not be entirely disregarded. This perspective integrates the idea of <b>a lower limit</b> (ensuring everyone has enough) with considerations about <b>the upper limit</b> (how resources are distributed beyond the lower limit).</p><p>The ethical framing of sufficiency in philosophy suggests considering <b>sufficiency corridors</b> to deliver justice and a good life for all without overshooting the planet’s ecological limits. Sufficiency corridors combine the ethical principles of sufficiency with scientific insights about ecological boundaries. These corridors challenge mainstream economics' focus on the sovereign consumer and its emphasis on nudges, behavioral change, and preferences.</p><p>Earth science advocates for the <b>planetary boundaries’ framework</b>, within which humanity should operate to keep the planet livable for future generations. This framework allows operationalizing the philosophical upper limit of sufficiency. The lower limit is about the fulfillment of fundamental human needs. Unlike current policies, sufficiency focuses on human needs rather than on needs satisfiers. It builds on <b>eudaimonic well-being</b>, which emphasizes societal well-being and long-term sustainability within planetary boundaries, fostering a sense of purpose, community, and environmental stewardship.</p><p>In "The Logic of Sufficiency," Thomas Princen defines sufficiency as <b>an organizing principle</b> that offers a compelling alternative to the dominant efficiency-driven model. Princen argues for prioritizing sufficiency over efficiency to address the environmental and economic challenges of the 21st century. He discusses how sufficiency can serve as an organizing principle for society, involving doing well with enough resources, promoting good governance, and ensuring long-term sustainability. This perspective requires a fundamental shift from the mainstream economic model, which emphasizes profit maximization, behavior change, and efficiency, towards a sufficiency economy driven by a practical approach to living well within limits.</p><p>Returning to the philosophical roots of <b>practice theory</b> helps identifying how sufficiency could organize our societies within sufficiency corridors. Practice theory emphasizes the importance of everyday practices, routines, and the ways in which <b>individuals are embedded in social and material contexts</b>. Integrating practice theory with the organizing principle of sufficiency offers a comprehensive framework for addressing the complex challenges of sustainability. Embodiment can deepen our understanding of how sufficiency is practiced in daily life. </p><p>Sustainable practices are not just about making conscious and rational choices, as mainstream economics suggests. Our choices are embodied in routines and habits and shaped by materiality. The design of products, buildings, and infrastructure heavily influences how our needs are satisfied. Practice theory helps us understand the complex interactions between individuals, communities, and their environments. This approach can reveal how social norms, cultural values, and community practices shape our daily lives. Addressing these relational dynamics fosters a culture of sufficiency supported by social networks and community engagement. Practice theory helps identify ways to make sufficiency more intuitive and integrated into daily life.</p><p>                  </p><p>Sufficiency transcends being merely a theoretical concept; it effectively bridges philosophical ideals with scientific pragmatism. It focuses on thriving within ecological limits rather than on denial or sacrifice. Given the global ecological constraints, sufficiency emerges as an ethical necessity, urging us to reevaluate our values and prioritize long-term sustainability over immediate benefits.</p>
