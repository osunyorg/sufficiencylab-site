summary: >
  Global transportation accounted for 23â€¯% of global energy-related emissions in 2019. These emissions are primarily driven by road transportation, and with projected growth in demand, a business-as-usual approach is likely to increase global emissions. <br><br>Policymakers have traditionally focused on technological solutions to reduce emissions. While these advancements are valuable, they often come with inherent limitations and potential risks. Furthermore, a growing body of research demonstrates that efficiency-based policies, aiming to decouple economic activity from environmental impact, are not enough for achieving absolute emission reductions and meeting sustainability goals.<br><br>A paradigm shift towards absolute demand reduction is crucial. The recent IPCC report highlights a growing interest in demand-side management strategies. However, transportation plays a vital role in fulfilling basic needs, posing a significant challenge for decarbonization efforts. To address this complexity, social equity considerations must be integrated alongside environmental goals.<br><br>Sufficiency policies offer a consistent framework for integrating both social and environmental goals by ensuring fundamental needs are fulfilled within the planetary boundaries. Sufficiency allows emission reductions by targetting their causes while delivering on human needs.
