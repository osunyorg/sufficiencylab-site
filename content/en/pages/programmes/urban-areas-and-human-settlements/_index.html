        <p>The global fashion system today is twice the size that it should be if we are to reach the 1.5Â° target of the Paris agreement by 2030. According to a report by Hot or Cool Institute (2022), efficiency measures alone, such as material innovation or improvements in production processes, cannot bring the industry to this goal. There is a need for sufficiency measures -drastic reductions in the production of new garments, especially cuts in the use of synthetic materials, such as polyester.</p><p>However, translating science to policy is not an easy endeavour considering that there is little understanding of how sufficiency policies could look like.</p><p>  </p><p>With legislation emerging to regulate fashion in Europe and the US, now is a perfect moment to deliberate, based on solid scientific evidence, on how to interpret normative targets for reductions into specific policy efforts.</p>
