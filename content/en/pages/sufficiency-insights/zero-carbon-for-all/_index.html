    <p>Comic  <br>Comic Marbles</p>  <p> Allocation Methods: Sufficientarianism and CBDR-RC Principles  <br>1. The Responsibility Approach: Grounding Climate Action in Historical Accountability The Responsibility Approach allocates the remaining global carbon budget by considering each country’s cumulative emissions and its share of the global population between 1970 and 2050. This timeframe captures both historical responsibility and projected demographic trends, offering a fair and intergenerational lens for climate accountability.  This method aligns with the  International Court of Justice’s (ICJ) July 2025 Advisory Opinion , which references key human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Vienna Convention, to clarify the legal obligations of states in addressing climate change.  By integrating historical emissions, the Responsibility Approach reflects the ethical imperative that those who have contributed most to the climate crisis must take proportionally greater action to mitigate it. Consistent with the principle of  Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) , this approach places more stringent carbon reduction obligations on high-emitting, industrialized nations, while allowing lower-emitting countries in the Global South greater flexibility to pursue development within ecological limits. The Responsibility Approach is central to  sufficiency-based frameworks  like  Zero Carbon for All,  which translate  climate justice  into  actionable national trajectories  and support  ethical pathways to the 1.5°C target. 2. The Capability-Driven Allocation: Linking Economic Capacity to Climate Responsibility The capability-driven allocation method distributes the remaining global carbon budget based on each country’s capacity to act, rather than solely its historical emissions. This approach combines two key indicators: a country’s cumulative population from 1970 to the most recent year available, and its latest GDP per capita (PPP-adjusted). Together, these metrics reflect both demographic weight and economic strength. Using the same calculation framework as the Responsibility scenario, this method replaces cumulative emissions with a composite capacity share, defined as: Country Capacity Share = (Cumulative Population × GDP PPP per capita) / Global Total This approach reflects the principle of  Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) , recognizing that countries with greater financial and technological capacity must shoulder a larger share of global mitigation efforts. It offers a forward-looking framework for estimating the level of compensation owed by overshooting countries to those that remain within their fair carbon share. Thus, addressing both  atmospheric appropriation  and  climate-related damages , and providing a  foundation for equitable climate negotiations. Within  sufficiency-based  frameworks like  Zero Carbon for All,   capability-driven allocation  ensures that  climate targets are not only fair, but also feasible.  Thus, anchoring ambition in both justice and practicality.</p>  <p> Data sources  <br>Territorial Historical CO2 emissions from 1970 to 2023:  Andrew, R. M., & Peters, G. P. (2024).
