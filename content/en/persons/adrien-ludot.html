biography: >-
  <p><b><i>Adrien LUDOT</i></b>  is a PhD candidate in Agricultural Policy at Humboldt University in Berlin. His research examines the design and implementation of agricultural and environmental policies, conflicts over biomass scarcity, and how the public sphere addresses these conflicts through sufficiency policies. He is particularly interested in how policy instruments are reconfiguring the French state's approach to biomass management.  </p>
