biography: >-
  <p>She entered Sciences Po in 2019, right after her baccalauréat, to learn about the political scene at national and international level and have a cross-sectoral background on current challenges. Classes, especially from her sociology major and   her exchange semester in Brighton, further shaped   her interests in social interactions and their systemic determinants and confirmed   her interest to pursue a career in the environmental field. Coline started her Environmental Policy master at PSIA in 2022, where she learnt about different types of policies, their interaction between themselves and with social realities, and the connection with academic concepts. Those classes, about biodiversity, degrowth, climate change mitigation, the energy transition, sustainable agriculture or water systems gave her essential knowledge for her future career. Before ending her last semester, she did three internships on sustainable agriculture and food systems, and their relation to the broader environment (e.g. biodiversity, water or social concerns), conducting projects, studies, and creating awareness programs.  This, along with volunteering in environmental NGOs (Sciences Po Environnement, Oxfam, Action Justice Climat), made her want to follow a career path on the ecological transition in France, from local to national level. </p>
