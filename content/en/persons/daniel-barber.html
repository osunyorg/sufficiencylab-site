  <p>              <a href="https://profiles.uts.edu.au/daniel.barber">Prof. Daniel A. Barber</a>, University of Technology, Sydney (Australia). His most recent book is <a href="https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/Nb9XCXLWokfN8B1QSVNZB6?domain=press.princeton.edu">Modern Architecture and Climate</a>: Design before Air Conditioning (Princeton University Press, 2020), following on <a href="https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/I2w7CYW8vlhZnkQ7s9JjIy?domain=global.oup.com">A House in the Sun</a>: Modern Architecture and Solar Energy in the Cold War (Oxford University Press, 2016). He is co-editor of the annual <a href="https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/54xpCZY1VmSRkPE6cyg-yl?domain=e-flux.com">Accumulation</a> series and of the forthcoming series "After Comfort: A User's Guide" both on the e-flux architecture online platform. Daniel recently co-edited, with Fallon Aidoo, a special issue of <a href="https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/u3TpC1WLrBhmPn14FYs2qD?domain=muse.jhu.edu">Future Anterior</a> focused on preservation and retrofit.   Daniel is part of the Cohabitations editorial collective, supporting interdisciplinary and multi-sited research on climate, displacement, and design. He lectures internationally, including recently "Architecture in the Overshoot" to close the exhibition Anthropocene at the Narodowy Intytut Architektury I Urbanistyki, Warsaw, Poland.   Daniel has also held academic positions and fellowships at Harvard, Penn, Princeton, and Yale, and at the Instituto Universitário de Lisboa, the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (Berlin), the Rachel Carson Center (Munich) and most recently as Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Apocalyptic and Post-Apocalyptic Studies (CAPAS), Universität Heidelberg.
