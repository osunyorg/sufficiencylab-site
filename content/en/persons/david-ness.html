biography: >-
  <p>              <a href="https://people.unisa.edu.au/david.ness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Prof. David Ness <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> from the <a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">University of South Australia <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> has a background in architecture, infrastructure planning, and strategic asset management. He conducts research on fair and sufficient resource use, co-organized the 1st International <a href="https://sufficiencysummit.com/">Sufficiency Summit</a>, and co-founded the World Sufficiency Lab. He pursues strategies by which wealthier societies may 'shrink' their absolute resource consumption and emissions, while redistributing resources to enable improved access to services and shelter for the disadvantaged. David has advised UN ESCAP and UN Habitat on resource efficient, integrated, and inclusive infrastructure, conducted UN training courses, chaired a China-based NFP on ecological development, and has over 120 publications.      </p>
