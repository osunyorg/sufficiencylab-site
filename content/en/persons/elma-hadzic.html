biography: >-
  <p>With a multidisciplinary background in the social sciences, Elma gradually specialized in economics and sociology through master's programs at Dauphine-PSL, MINES-PSL, and EHESS. During her gap year, she entered the energy sector, interning at EDF and then at a German transmission system operator, 50 Hertz, in Berlin. These experiences led her to pursue the EEET master's program at AgroParisTech, where she completed her studies with a degree in energy and environmental economics. Elma then joined I4CE for ehr final internship, where she worked on quantifying adaptation in energy sector. She is currently pursuing a PhD funded by ADEME and developing a global macroeconomic model at OFCE to explore and design scenarios of sufficiency.  </p>
