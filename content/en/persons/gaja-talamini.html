biography: >-
  <p><i><b>Gaja TALAMINI</b></i> grew up in the Italian countryside, with the Alps framed by her bedroom window. She has always been captivated by the natural world-from the tiniest insects to the moose that once crossed a gravel road in front of her during her time living in Canada, where she moved after finishing school. Later, she crossed the Atlantic again to study Politics and International Relations in a small English town, and shortly after graduating, she fulfilled a childhood dream by working at WWF. Driven by a growing desire to better understand the forces threatening the world she love, she left her dream job to move to Paris. She is now about to graduate with a Master’s in Environmental Policy.</p>
