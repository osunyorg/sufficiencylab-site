biography: >-
  <p>Jarmo Kikstra is a research scholar at IIASA and PhD candidate at Imperial College London, working with integrated assessment models (IAMs). He has contributed to multiple UNEP Emission Gap Reports and the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report - coordinating and implementing climate simulations for mitigation pathways. His work revolves around understanding globally just transitions. Central is combining climate mitigation scenarios with universal human needs provisioning. Related to this, Jarmo's work has been focused on Decent Living Standards and energy requirements, but he is also interested in the economic impacts of climate change, post-growth scenarios, and justice and equity in scenarios more broadly.      </p>
