He has contributed to multiple UNEP Emission Gap Reports and the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report - coordinating and implementing climate simulations for mitigation pathways. His work revolves around understanding globally just transitions. Central is combining climate mitigation scenarios with universal human needs provisioning.
