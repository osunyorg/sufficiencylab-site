<p>Joel is an interdisciplinary researcher focusing on thorny conceptual and modelling issues in the areas of human well-being, global development, inequality, climate change, energy and resource use, and environmental justice; strongly focusing upon means to secure human well-being without overshooting planetary boundaries. By synthesising this wide array of social and environmental sciences, he hopes to further interdisciplinary research area on the (in)equity of energy &amp; resource use in societies and the reimagining of fair and sustainable futures.<b></b><br></p>
