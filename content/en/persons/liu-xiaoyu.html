biography: >-
  <p>She am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Environmental Policy at Sciences Po Paris. Beyond academics, I enjoy outdoor adventures such as hiking, which allows me to reconnect with nature and find fresh inspiration. In my free time, I also practice watercolor painting, the guzheng, and Chinese calligraphy.</p>
