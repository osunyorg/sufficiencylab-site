Prior to this, Niklas was Associate Professor in European history and Chair of Centre of Modern European Studies (CEMES) at the University of Copenhagen, a visiting fellow at the Cambridge Center of Political Thought, and a visiting researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in the Humanities at the University of Essen.   Niklas holds degrees in history from UCPH (MA) and the EUI (PhD).
