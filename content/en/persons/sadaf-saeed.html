  <p>              <a href="https://cur.org.au/people/sadaf-saeed/"><b>Dr. Sadaf Saeed</b></a> is an urban infrastructure planner, professionally trained in Australia, Germany, and Pakistan.   Her professional experience includes over ten years' working in the field of urban planning and transport planning at different strategic positions in industry as well as an urban planning academic.  She observes that urban and transport planning is inextricably linked for sustainable outcomes, and her research and teaching interests span these two fields. Her research work particularly challenges the role of place-based variations while transferring and implementing transport policy solutions. She was awarded with higher degree research scholarship in RMIT university and pursued her PhD in transport planning from the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/research/centres-collaborations/centre-for-urban-research">Centre of Urban Research, RMIT</a>. She examined the place-based variations and implications of bus rapid transit concept from a low-cost mobility option to a high-cost transport infrastructure by using the concept of Actor Network Theory. She was also awarded with one of the most competitive development related scholarships under German Academic Exchange Service (<a href="https://www.daad.de/en/">https://www.daad.de/en/</a>) and completed Masters in Infrastructure Planning from Stuttgart University. Another significant achievement on her profile is industry experience of implementing first bus rapid transit concept in Lahore as director planning Punjab.    </p><p> Sadaf works as a strategic transport planner at City of Whittlesea, Melbourne.
