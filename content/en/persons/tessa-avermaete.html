<p><a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00058207" target="_blank">Ms. Tessa Avermaete</a>Â is project manager at the Sustainable Food Economies Research Group (SFERE) of Leuven University. She manages interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary consortia that are working in the domain of food security, sustainable food systems, agriculture, and sustainable diets. She focuses on the European context, where the food system is characterized by a growing gap between consumers and producers, inequality, the prevalence of obesity, a polarized debate on sustainable food systems and a continuous decrease in the number of farmers. Tessa Avermaete was involved in the High-Level Steering Board of the European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural productivity and Sustainability (EIP-AGRI) and in the focus group on new entrants in farming. She is a member of diverse working groups at the national, regional, and local level, contributing to an evidence-based transition of the food system and empowerment of all the actors in the system. She was nominated for the science battle for her work in reaching out current insights on food and farming to children.<br></p>
