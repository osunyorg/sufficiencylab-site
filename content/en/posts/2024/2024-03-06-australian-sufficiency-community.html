        <p>With the support of Australian-French Association for Research and Innovation (AFRAN) and others, this community is currently being established in Australia, led from the city of Adelaide and University of South Australia (via SIRM).  This follows the ‘1st Sufficiency Summit’ May 2023, which was also supported by AFRAN.</p><p>An initial focus is to build upon the ‘Adaptive Reuse’ Policy led by the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, aiming to identify vacant office buildings suitable for conversion to much needed housing.</p>
