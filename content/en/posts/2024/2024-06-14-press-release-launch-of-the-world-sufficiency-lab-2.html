    <p>NEED FOR A ‘SUFFICIENCY REFLEX’ TO MEET CLIMATE TARGETS </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>14.06. 2024 <br>PRESS RELEASE <br>NEED FOR A ‘SUFFICIENCY REFLEX’ TO MEET CLIMATE TARGETS <br>After being enacted in the French Energy Sufficiency Law of 2015 and introduced in the 2022 IPCC Report on <br>Climate Mitigation, the sufficiency concept has been re-ignited as the only way to reach climate and other <br>global targets, with climate and social justice at its core. The Webinar Launch The Webinar, the first in a series, was hosted by the Sciences Po EU Chair for Sustainable Development and Climate Transition, in <br>collaboration with the World Resources Forum. of the World Sufficiency Lab <br>(WSL) Paris on 13 June, with an initial focus on high-consuming OECD countries, demonstrated a surge of <br>interest and momentum world-wide. <br>Following the welcome and introduction by WSL co-founder Prof David Ness, Ms Diane Simiu, Climate Change <br>Director at the French Ministry of the Energy Transition, set the tone in an inspirational keynote. Ms Simiu <br>emphasised that carbon neutrality could not be reached without sufficiency, which alone could cut emissions of <br>France by 10% by 2030. According to Ms Simiu, a ‘sufficiency reflex’ is required in decision-making, not only for <br>energy use but also materials, land use, water and more. <br>WSL instigator and co-founder Dr Yamina Saheb explained the novel Web Platform, including a Library, Academy, <br>and Communities. The WSL team, including Dr Katia Vladimirov, Pierre Noro, Valentin Stuhlfauth, and Florian <br>Guillanton, explained the importance of sufficiency in urban planning, buildings, mobility, clothing, and <br>digitalisation, with health and nutrition also on the agenda. A Roundtable, moderated by Mr Emanuele di <br>Francesco of World Resources Forum, then showed how the WSL would connect with regional and/or national <br>Sufficiency Hubs, beginning with the EU, Australia, North America, and the Republic of Korea. The ultimate target <br>is to build a global Sufficiency Community, which will ensure sufficiency is considered FIRST in policy and business <br>decisions. <br>Among key messages, Ms Claire Roumet, leader of EU Policy and Strategic Partnerships at Energy Cities, <br>highlighted the importance of being ‘resource wise’, with binding targets to avoid resource demand. The Lord <br>Mayor of Adelaide, Hon Dr Jane Lomax-Smith, recognised the potential to build on sufficiency upon South <br>Australian leadership in renewables and circularity, in areas such as buildings, fast fashion and local food growing. <br>Reiterating that climate goals cannot be met without sufficiency, Ms Lisa Richmond was excited to share the <br>initiative of Architecture 2030 on establishing a ‘Built Environment Sufficiency Hub’ in North America. Ms Jungin <br>Hwang and Mr Jungpil Lee, Director of the Energy Climate Policy Institute, Seoul, recognised the importance of <br>sufficiency in complementing current efficiency policies in Korea and tackling the rise in energy demand. <br>ENDS. <br>Contacts for enquiries:Prof. David Ness: david.ness@unisa.edu.auDr. Yamina Saheb: yamina.saheb@sciencespo.fr</p>  <p>   <br>Press Release</p>

  After being enacted in the French Energy Sufficiency Law of 2015 and introduced in the 2022 IPCC Report on Climate Mitigation, the sufficiency concept has been re-ignited as the only way to reach climate and other global targets, with climate and social justice at its core. The Webinar Launch  of the World Sufficiency Lab (WSL) Paris on 13 June, with an initial focus on high-consuming OECD countries, demonstrated a surge of interest and momentum world-wide.
