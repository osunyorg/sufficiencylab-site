        <p>Efforts to reduce the emissions of urban settlements, responsible for around 70â€¯% of the global total, have largely overlooked the high potential of policies that constrain the growth of material stocks and consumption carbon. The challenge is to ensure societal wellbeing, equitable access to services and dramatic cuts in emissions via leaner and resource-saving built form, planning configurations and more interconnected, cost effective and less carbon-intensive infrastructure solutions. Examples of such policies and best practice solutions will be examined, while highlighting their potential to transform approaches in the global North and South and dramatically reduce carbon, resources and cost.<br></p>
