  Our Sufficiency Library is a collaborative, open wiki-style platform overseen by a scientific steering committee in charge of the initial curation of resources. It hosts a multimedia repository for sufficiency-related data, publications, analyses, case studies, business models, and ongoing research projects. This wealth of knowledge is available to everyone to inform and inspire sustainable practices. It is also a space for the documentation of existing projects, assessing impact and identifying best practices.
